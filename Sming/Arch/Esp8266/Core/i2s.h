/*
How does this work? Basically, to get sound, you need to:
- Connect an I2S codec to the I2S pins on the ESP.
- Start up a thread that's going to do the sound output
- Call i2s_begin()
- Call i2s_set_rate() with the sample rate you want.
- Generate sound and call i2s_write_sample() with 32-bit samples.
The 32bit samples basically are 2 16-bit signed values (the analog values for
the left and right channel) concatenated as (Rout<<16)+Lout

i2s_write_sample will block when you're sending data too quickly, so you can just
generate and push data as fast as you can and i2s_write_sample will regulate the
speed.
