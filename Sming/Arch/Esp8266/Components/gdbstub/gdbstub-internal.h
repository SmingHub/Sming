/*
 * Defines our debugging exception frame which is provided to GDB when paused.
 * Our exception handlers save register values here, restoring them on continuation.
 * Any register changes made by GDB are stored here.
 *
 * System exceptions are initially handled by the Xtensa HAL, which saves some (but not all)
 * registers into a `UserFrame` structure (see xtensa/xtruntime-frames.h).
 * Control passes to gdbstub_exception_handler, which copies those values plus some extra ones.
 *
 * Debug exceptions are handled entirely by gdbstub_debug_exception_entry, which saves
 * registers, calls gdbstub_handle_debug_exception, then restores them.
 *
 * Using the macros provided by xtensa allow changes to this structure to be reflected into
 * both C and assembler code.
