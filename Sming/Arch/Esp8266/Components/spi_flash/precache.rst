IRAM pre-caching
----------------

This is taken from the esp8266 arduino core. For details see:

- https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/pull/6628
- https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/issues/6559

See :doc:`/information/memory` and :doc:`/information/flash` for some background.

Code is always executed from IRAM, however it must be read in from flash memory on
first use which can cause issues within timing-critical code.

This can be avoided by placing the code in IRAM.
However, IRAM is a very limited resource and should generally be reserved
for interrupt service routines.

An alternative solution is to arrange for critical code to be pre-loaded into IRAM
before it starts execution.


.. note::

   This cannot be used for interrupt service routines.

   By their nature, interrupts are essentially random events and therefore code
   must be available in IRAM at any time.

The steps required are:

1. Mark the function containing code using IRAM_PRECACHE_ATTR
2. Place a call to IRAM_PRECACHE_START(tag) *before* the first line of critical code
3. Place a call to IRAM_PRECACHE_END(tag) *after* the last line of critical code

You must always declare a tag to avoid the risk of section name conflicts.

You can find an example of how precaching is used here:
