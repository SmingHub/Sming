 * Original Author: Adapted from tzcode maintained by Arthur David Olson.
 * Modifications:
 * - Changed to mktm_r and added __tzcalc_limits - 04/10/02, Jeff Johnston
 * - Fixed bug in mday computations - 08/12/04, Alex Mogilnikov <alx@intellectronika.ru>
 * - Fixed bug in __tzcalc_limits - 08/12/04, Alex Mogilnikov <alx@intellectronika.ru>
 * - Move code from _mktm_r() to gmtime_r() - 05/09/14, Freddie Chopin <freddie_chopin@op.pl>
 * - Fixed bug in calculations for dates after year 2069 or before year 1901. Ideas for
 *   solution taken from musl's __secs_to_tm() - 07/12/2014, Freddie Chopin
 *   <freddie_chopin@op.pl>
 * - Use faster algorithm from civil_from_days() by Howard Hinnant - 12/06/2014,
 * Freddie Chopin <freddie_chopin@op.pl>
 *
 * Converts the calendar time pointed to by tim_p into a broken-down time
 * expressed as local time. Returns a pointer to a structure containing the
 * broken-down time.
