Host UART driver
================

.. highlight:: bash

Introduction
------------

Implements a UART driver to connect via TCP socket, allowing terminal emulation using telnet,
or directly to local host serial device (e.g. /dev/ttyUSB0, COM4, etc.)

By default, output to UART0 is sent to the console and keyboard input is written to the UART0 receive queue.
If emulation is enabled on any ports then this behaviour is disabled.


Build variables
---------------

.. envvar:: ENABLE_HOST_UARTID

   To enable emulation for a UART, set this value to the numbers required.
   You would normally add this to a project's component.mk file.
   
   For example::
   
      ENABLE_HOST_UARTID = 0 1

   If setting it on the command line, remember to use quotes::

      make ENABLE_HOST_UARTID="0 1"

   See :sample:`Basic_Serial` which uses both serial ports like this.


.. envvar:: HOST_UART_PORTBASE

   The base port number to use for telnet. Default is 10000, which corresponds to UART0.
   
   This is passed to the command line ``--uartport`` option.


.. envvar:: HOST_UART_OPTIONS

   By default, this value combines the above options.

   Allows full customisation of UART command-line options for ``make run``.


TCP port emulation
------------------

Set required ports for emulation using the :envvar:`ENABLE_HOST_UARTID`, then execute ``make run``.

.. note::

   As an alternative to ``make run``, you can run the compiled application manually like this::
   
      out/Host/debug/firmware/app --pause --uart=0 --uart=1

Now start a telnet session for each serial port, in separate command windows::

   telnet localhost 10000
   telnet localhost 10001

In the application window, press Enter. This behaviour is enabled by the
``pause`` option, which stops the emulator after initialisation so
telnet can connect to it. Without ``pause`` you’ll lose any serial
output at startup.)

.. note::

   For Windows users, ``putty`` is a good alternative to telnet. It also
   has options for things like carriage-return/linefeed translation
   (“\\n” -> “\\r\\n`”). Run using::
   
      putty telnet://localhost:10000
   
Port numbers are allocated sequentially from 10000. If you want to use
different port numbers, set :envvar:`HOST_UART_PORTBASE`.


Physical device connection
--------------------------

Override :envvar:`HOST_UART_OPTIONS` adding the `--device` option. For example::

   make run HOST_UART_OPTIONS="--uart=0 --device=/dev/ttyUSB0"

The ``--device`` option must follow the ``--uart`` option. Another example::

   make run HOST_UART_OPTIONS="--uart=0 --device=/dev/ttyUSB0 --uart=1 --device=/dev/ttyUSB1"

The port is opened when ``uart_init()`` gets called.

The default baud rate is whatever the application has requested. This can be overridden as follows::

   make run HOST_UART_OPTIONS="--uart=0 --device=/dev/ttyUSB0 --baud=921600"

For Windows, substitute the appropriate device name, e.g. ``COM4`` instead of ``/dev/ttyUSB0``.

.. note::

   If necessary, add ``ENABLE_HOST_UARTID=`` to prevent telnet windows from being created.
