 * 	system is not actually ready; there is otherwise no point in queueing the
 * 	callback as it would never get invoked. To avoid unpredictable behaviour and
 * 	simplify application code, the callback is invoked immediately in this situation.
 *
 * 	Global task queue added to class, initialised at system startup.
