DHTesp
===

An Arduino library for reading the DHT family of temperature and humidity sensors.    
Forked from [arduino-DHT](https://github.com/markruys/arduino-DHT)     
Original written by Mark Ruys, <mark@paracas.nl>.    

Why did I clone this library instead of forking the original repo and push the changes?
When I searched through Github for DHT libraries, I found a lot of them, some of them offers additional functions, some of them only basic temperature and humidity values. I wanted to combine all interesting functions into one library. In addition, none of the DHT libraries I found were written to work without errors on the ESP32. For ESP32 (a multi core/ multi processing SOC) task switching must be disabled while reading data from the sensor.    
Another problem I found is that many of the available libraries use the same naming (dht.h, dht.cpp), which easily leads to conflicts if different libraries are used for different platforms.    

The library is tested as well on ESP8266 and should work on AVR boards as well.    

Changes to the original library:
--------
- 2017-12-12: Renamed DHT class to DHTesp and filenames from dht.* to DHTesp.* to avoid conflicts with other libraries - beegee-tokyo, <beegee@giesecke.tk>.    
- 2017-12-12: Updated to work with ESP32 - beegee-tokyo, <beegee@giesecke.tk>.   
- 2017-12-12: Added function computeHeatIndex. Reference: [Adafruit DHT library](https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library).    
- 2017-12-14: Added function computeDewPoint. Reference: [idDHTLib](https://github.com/niesteszeck/idDHTLib).    
- 2017-12-14: Added function getComfortRatio. Reference: [libDHT](https://github.com/ADiea/libDHT). (References about Human Comfort invalid)    
- 2017-12-15: Added function computePerception. Reference: [WikiPedia Dew point==> Relationship to human comfort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dew_point) - beegee-tokyo, <beegee@giesecke.tk>.   
- 2018-01-02: Added example for multiple sensors usage.    
- 2018-01-03: Added function getTempAndHumidity which returns temperature and humidity in one call.    
- 2018-01-03: Added retry in case the reading from the sensor fails with a timeout.    
- 2018-01-08: Added ESP8266 (and probably AVR) compatibility.    

Features
--------
  - Support for DHT11 and DHT22, AM2302, RHT03
  - Auto detect sensor model
  - Determine heat index
  - Determine dewpoint
  - Determine thermal comfort:
    * Empiric comfort function based on comfort profiles(parametric lines)
    * Multiple comfort profiles possible. Default based on http://epb.apogee.net/res/refcomf.asp  (References invalid)
    * Determine if it's too cold, hot, humid, dry, based on current comfort profile
    * More info at [Determining Thermal Comfort Using a Humidity and Temperature Sensor](https://www.azosensors.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=487)
  - Determine human perception based on humidity, temperature and dew point according to Horstmeyer, Steve (2006-08-15). [Relative Humidity....Relative to What? The Dew Point Temperature...a better approach](http://www.shorstmeyer.com/wxfaqs/humidity/humidity.html)

Functions
-----
_**`void setup(uint8_t pin, DHT_MODEL_t model=AUTO_DETECT);`**_    
- Call to initialize the interface, define the GPIO pin to which the sensor is connected and define the sensor type. Valid sensor types are:     
    - AUTO_DETECT     Try to detect which sensor is connected    
    - DHT11    
    - DHT22    
    - AM2302          Packaged DHT22    
    - RHT03           Equivalent to DHT22    

_**`void resetTimer();`**_    
- Reset last time the sensor was read    

_**`float getTemperature();`**_    
- Get the temperature in degree Centigrade from the sensor    
Either one of  _`getTemperature()`_ or  _`getHumidity()`_ or  _`getTempAndHumidity()`_ initiates reading a value from the sensor if the last reading was older than the minimal refresh time of the sensor.    
See example _`DHT_ESP32.ino`_ or _`DHT_Test.ino`_    

_**`float getHumidity();`**_    
- Get the humidity from the sensor     
Either one of  _`getTemperature()`_ or  _`getHumidity()`_ or  _`getTempAndHumidity()`_ initiates reading a value from the sensor if the last reading was older than the minimal refresh time of the sensor.    
See example _`DHT_ESP32.ino`_ or _`DHT_Test.ino`_    

_**`TempAndHumidity getTempAndHumidity();`**_    
- Get the temperature and humidity from the sensor     
Either one of _`getTemperature()`_ or  _`getHumidity()`_ or  _`getTempAndHumidity()`_ initiates reading a value from the sensor if the last reading was older than the minimal refresh time of the sensor.    
Return value is a struct of type _`TempAndHumidity`_ with temperature and humidity as float values.
See example _`DHT_Multi.ino`_    

_**`DHT_ERROR_t getStatus();`**_    
- Get last error if reading from the sensor failed. Possible values are:    
  - ERROR_NONE      no error occured
  - ERROR_TIMEOUT   timeout reading from the sensor    
  - ERROR_CHECKSUM  checksum of received values doesn't match
