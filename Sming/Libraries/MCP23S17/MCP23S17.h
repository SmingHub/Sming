/*
 MCP23S17.h  Version 0.1
 Microchip MCP23S17 SPI I/O Expander Class for Arduino
 Created by Cort Buffington & Keith Neufeld
 March, 2011

 Features Implemented (by word and bit):
 I/O Direction
 Pull-up on/off
 Input inversion
 Output write
 Input read

 Interrupt features are not implemented in this version
 byte based (portA, portB) functions are not implemented in this version

 NOTE:  Addresses below are only valid when IOCON.BANK=0 (register addressing mode)
 This means one of the control register values can change register addresses!
 The default values is 0, so that's how we're using it.

 All registers except ICON (0xA and 0xB) are paired as A/B for each 8-bit GPIO port.
 Comments identify the port's name, and notes on how it is used.

 *THIS CLASS ENABLES THE ADDRESS PINS ON ALL CHIPS ON THE BUS WHEN THE FIRST CHIP OBJECT IS INSTANTIATED!

 USAGE: All Read/Write functions except wordWrite are implemented in two different ways.
 Individual pin values are set by referencing "pin #" and On/Off, Input/Output or High/Low where
 portA represents pins 0-7 and portB 8-15. So to set the most significant bit of portB, set pin # 15.
 To Read/Write the values for the entire chip at once, a word mode is supported buy passing a
 single argument to the function as 0x(portB)(portA). I/O mode Output is represented by 0.
 The wordWrite function was to be used internally, but was made public for advanced users to have
 direct and more efficient control by writing a value to a specific register pair.
