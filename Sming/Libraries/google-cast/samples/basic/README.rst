Google Cast Client
==================

Sample application that demonstrates how to send information directly from your application to your Smart TV using the Google Cast protocol.

A media file is started playing. From the terminal, you can control as follows:

'f':   Skip forward 10 seconds
'r':   Skip back 10 seconds
space: Toggle between pause and play
'q':   Quit playback

The chromecast device must be online at startup, or a connection error will result.
Re-start the application to retry.
