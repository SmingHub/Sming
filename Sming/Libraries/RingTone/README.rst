RingTone
========

This library provides support for parsing and playing tunes in
`RTTTL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_Tone_Transfer_Language>`__ format.

RTTTL conversion code based on https://github.com/end2endzone/NonBlockingRTTTL.

The parser is stream-based and allows random seeking where the stream supports it.

An RTTTL writer is also included to assist with editing/creation of RTTTL files.
