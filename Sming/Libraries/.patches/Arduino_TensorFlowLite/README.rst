Arduino TensorFlow Lite
=======================

This library runs TensorFlow machine learning models on microcontrollers, allowing you to build AI/ML applications powered by deep learning and neural networks.

With the included examples, you can recognize speech, detect people using a camera, and recognise "magic wand" gestures using an accelerometer.

The examples work best with the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board, which has a microphone and accelerometer.
