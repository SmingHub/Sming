/*
This example uses a mercury tilt switch to detect the orientation
of a robot. If you turn the bot over, it falls asleep to conserve
battery life.  If you have ever used a tilt switch before,
you know they can be very "noisy" - they jump around a lot!
The bounce library can handle sensing when a noisy switch has
"settled down"  with the "duration" method that tells you how long
the pin has been in the current state.
