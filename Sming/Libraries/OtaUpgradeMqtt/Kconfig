        help
            If enabled, the OTA upgrade mechanism and application will use a `varint <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding#varints>`_
            encoding for the patch version. Thus allowing unlimited number of patch versions. Useful for enumerating unstable/nightly releases.
            A bit more difficult to read and write but allows for unlimited versions.

            If set to 0 the OTA upgrade mechanism and application will use one byte for the patch version which will limit it to 256 possible patch versions.
            Useful for enumerating stable releases. Easier to write and read but limited to 256 versions only.

    config ENABLE_OTA_ADVANCED
        bool "Support firmware signing/encryption"
        help
           Enabling this option allows the library to work with OtaUpgradeStream which supports signature and encryption of the firmware data itself.
           In the application the AdvancedPayloadParser can be used to do the MQTT message handling.
