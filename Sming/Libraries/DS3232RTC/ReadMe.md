## Introduction ##
**DS3232RTC** is an Arduino library that supports the Maxim Integrated DS3232 and DS3231 Real-Time Clocks. This library is intended to be used with the [Arduino Time library](http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Code/Time).

The **DS3232RTC** library is a drop-in replacement for the DS1307RTC.h library by Michael Margolis that is supplied with the Arduino Time library above. To change from using a DS1307 RTC to an DS323x RTC, it is only necessary to use `#include <DS3232RTC.h>` instead of `#include <DS1307RTC.h>`.

This library is ***not*** a drop-in replacement for [PJRC's newer version of the DS1307RTC library](http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_DS1307RTC.html).

**DS3232RTC** also implements functions to support the additional features of the DS3232 and DS3231. The DS3231 has the same features as the DS3232 except: (1) Battery-backed SRAM, (2) Battery-backed 32kHz output (BB32kHz bit in Control/Status register 0x0F), and (3) Adjustable temperature sensor sample rate (CRATE1:0 bits in the Control/Status register).

## Installation ##
To use the **DS3232RTC** library:  
- Go to https://github.com/JChristensen/DS3232RTC, click the **Download ZIP** button and save the ZIP file to a convenient location on your PC.
- Uncompress the downloaded file.  This will result in a folder containing all the files for the library, that has a name that includes the branch name, usually **DS3232RTC-master**.
- Rename the folder to just **DS3232RTC**.
- Copy the renamed folder to the Arduino sketchbook\libraries folder.

## Examples ##
The following example sketches are included with the **DS3232RTC** library:
- **SetSerial:** Set the RTC's date and time from the Arduino serial monitor. Displays date, time and temperature.
- **TimeRTC:** Same as the example of the same name provided with the **Time** library, demonstrating the interchangeability of the **DS3232RTC** library with the **DS1307RTC** library.
- **tiny3232_KnockBang:** Demonstrates interfacing an ATtiny45/85 to a DS3231 or DS3232 RTC.

## Usage notes ##

When using the **DS3232RTC** library, the user is responsible for ensuring that reads and writes do not exceed the device's address space (0x00-0x12 for DS3231, 0x00-0xFF for DS3232); no bounds checking is done by the library.            

Similar to the **DS1307RTC** library, the **DS3232RTC** library instantiates an RTC object; the user does not need to do this.

To use the **DS3232RTC** library, the Time and Wire libraries must also be included.  For brevity, these includes are not repeated in the examples below:
```c++
#include <DS3232RTC.h>    //http://github.com/JChristensen/DS3232RTC
#include <Time.h>         //http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Code/Time
#include <Wire.h>         //http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/Wire (included with Arduino IDE)
```

## Alarm methods ##
The DS3232 and DS3231 have two alarms. Alarm1 can be set to seconds precision; Alarm2 can only be set to minutes precision.

###setAlarm(ALARM_TYPES_t alarmType, byte seconds, byte minutes, byte hours, byte daydate)
#####Description
Set an alarm time. Sets the alarm registers only.  To cause the INT pin to be asserted on alarm match, use alarmInterrupt(). This method can set either Alarm 1 or Alarm 2, depending on the value of alarmType (use the ALARM_TYPES_t enumeration above). When setting Alarm 2, the seconds value must be supplied but is ignored, recommend using zero. (Alarm 2 has no seconds register.)

#####Syntax
`RTC.setAlarm(alarmType, seconds, minutes, hours, dayOrDate);`
#####Parameters
**alarmType:** A value from the ALARM_TYPES_t enumeration, above. *(ALARM_TYPES_t)*  
**seconds:** The seconds value to set the alarm to. *(byte)*  
**minutes:** The minutes value to set the alarm to. *(byte)*  
**hours:** The hours value to set the alarm to. *(byte)*  
**dayOrDate:** The day of the week or the date of the month. For day of the week, use a value from the Time library timeDayOfWeek_t enumeration, i.e. dowSunday, dowMonday, dowTuesday, dowWednesday, dowThursday, dowFriday, dowSaturday. *(byte)*  
#####Returns
None.
#####Example
```c++
//Set Alarm1 for 12:34:56 on Sunday
RTC.setAlarm(ALM1_MATCH_DAY, 56, 34, 12, dowSunday);
```

###setAlarm(ALARM_TYPES_t alarmType, byte minutes, byte hours, byte daydate)
#####Description
Set an alarm time. Sets the alarm registers only.  To cause the INT pin to be asserted on alarm match, use alarmInterrupt().  This method can set either Alarm 1 or Alarm 2, depending on the value of alarmType (use the ALARM_TYPES_t enumeration above). However, when using this method to set Alarm 1, the seconds value is set to zero. (Alarm 2 has no seconds register.)

#####Syntax
`RTC.setAlarm(alarmType, minutes, hours, dayOrDate);`
#####Parameters
**alarmType:** A value from the ALARM_TYPES_t enumeration, above. *(ALARM_TYPES_t)*  
**minutes:** The minutes value to set the alarm to. *(byte)*  
**hours:** The hours value to set the alarm to. *(byte)*  
**dayOrDate:** The day of the week or the date of the month. For day of the week, use a value from the Time library timeDayOfWeek_t enumeration, i.e. dowSunday, dowMonday, dowTuesday, dowWednesday, dowThursday, dowFriday, dowSaturday. *(byte)*  
#####Returns
None.
#####Example
```c++
//Set Alarm2 for 12:34 on the 4th day of the month
RTC.setAlarm(ALM1_MATCH_DATE, 34, 12, 4);
```

###alarmInterrupt(byte alarmNumber, boolean alarmEnabled)
#####Description
Enable or disable an alarm "interrupt". Note that this "interrupt" causes the RTC's INT pin to be asserted. To use this signal as an actual interrupt to a microcontroller, it will need to be connected properly and programmed in the application firmware.
on the RTC.   
#####Syntax
`RTC.alarmInterrupt(alarmNumber, enable);`
#####Parameters
**alarmNumber:** The number of the alarm to enable or disable, ALARM_1 or ALARM_2 *(byte)*  
**alarmEnabled:** true or false *(boolean)*  
#####Returns
None.
#####Example
```c++
RTC.alarmInterrupt(ALARM_1, true);      //assert the INT pin when Alarm1 occurs.
RTC.alarmInterrupt(ALARM_2, false);     //disable Alarm2
```

###alarm(byte alarmNumber)
#####Description
Tests whether an alarm has been triggered. If the alarm was triggered, returns true and resets the alarm flag in the RTC, else returns false.
#####Syntax
`RTC.alarm(alarmNumber);`
#####Parameters
**alarmNumber:** The number of the alarm to test, ALARM_1 or ALARM_2 *(byte)*  
#####Returns
Description *(type)*
#####Example
```c++
if ( RTC.alarm(ALARM_1) ) {		//has Alarm1 triggered?
	//yes, act on the alarm
}
else {
	//no alarm
}
```

## Other methods ##
###temperature(void)
#####Description
Returns the RTC temperature.
#####Syntax
`RTC.temperature();`
#####Parameters
None.
#####Returns
RTC temperature as degrees Celsius times four. *(int)*
#####Example
```c++
int t = RTC.temperature();
float celsius = t / 4.0;
float fahrenheit = celsius * 9.0 / 5.0 + 32.0;
```

###squareWave(SQWAVE_FREQS_t freq)
#####Description
Enables or disables the square wave output.
#####Syntax
`RTC.squareWave(freq);`
#####Parameters
**freq:** a value from the SQWAVE_FREQS_t enumeration above. *(SQWAVE_FREQS_t)*  
#####Returns
None.
#####Example
```c++
RTC.squareWave(SQWAVE_1_HZ);	//1 Hz square wave
RTC.squareWave(SQWAVE_NONE);	//no square wave
```

###oscStopped(bool clearOSF)
#####Description
Returns the value of the oscillator stop flag (OSF) bit in the control/status register which indicates that the oscillator is or was stopped, and that the timekeeping data may be invalid. Optionally clears the OSF bit depending on the argument passed. If the `clearOSF` argument is omitted, the OSF bit is cleared by default. Calls to `set()` and `write()` also clear the OSF bit.

#####Syntax
`RTC.oscStopped(clearOSF);`
#####Parameters
**clearOSF:** an optional true or false value to indicate whether the OSF bit should be cleared (reset). If not supplied, a default value of true is used, resetting the OSF bit. *(bool)*
#####Returns
True or false *(bool)*
#####Example
```c++
if ( RTC.oscStopped(false) ) {		//check the oscillator
	//may be trouble
}
else {
