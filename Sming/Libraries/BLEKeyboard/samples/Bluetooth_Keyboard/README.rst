Bluetooth Keyboard
==================

This sample demonstrates how to turn an Esp32 device into external keyboard. 
The "keyboard" and your PC will be communicating using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
The "keyboard" will write words, press Enter, press a media key and, if enabled in the sample code, Ctrl+Alt+Delete.

Usage
-----
Once this sample is flashed and running on your ESP32 you can test it.
Open a new text editor on your PC. Then search from your PC for new bluetooth devices. 
A device named "Sming BLE Keyboard" should show up. Connect to it and focus/open you text editor window.
Be fast. Soon enough a "Hello World" text will start to be "magically" typed inside your text editor.
