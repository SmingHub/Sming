CS5460 energy meter IC
======================

The CS5460(A) is a highly integrated power measurement solution which combines two Analog-to-digital Converters (ADCs), high-speed power calculation functions, and a serial interface on a single chip. It is designed to accurately measure and calculate: Real (True) Energy, Instantaneous Power, I RMS , and V RMS for single phase 2- or 3-wire power metering applications.
