//
// @brief
// Implement a basic IO library to drive the PCF8574* I2C IO Expander ASIC.
// The library implements basic IO general methods to configure IO pin direction
// read and write uint8_t operations and basic pin level routines to set or read
// a particular IO port.
//
// @version API 1.0.0
