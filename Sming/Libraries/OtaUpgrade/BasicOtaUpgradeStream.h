/**
 * @brief A write-only stream to parse and apply firmware unencrypted upgrade files generated by otatool.py
 *
 * The class fully automates the firmware upgrade process without any manual 
 * configuration. At construction time, the rBoot configuration is read to determine 
 * the unused ROM slot which should receive the upgrade.
 * Just feed the upgrade file content into the `write()` method in arbitrarily 
 * sized chunks. The relevant portion(s) of the Flash memory (currently only the 
 * application rom) are updated on the fly as data arrives. When the file is complete
 * and signature validation (if enabled) was successful, the updated slot is activated
 * in the rBoot configuration.
 * Call `hasError()` and/or check the public \c #errorCode member to determine if 
 * everything went smoothly.
 * 
 * For further information on configuration options and the file format, 
 * refer to the library's documentation.
 * 
 * @see `EncryptedOtaUpgradeStream` for encryption support.
