Software SPI
===========

Software SPI is likely to be of use only for ESP8266, but is enabled for all architectures.

The ESP8266 can manage a minimum of about 70ns between bit edges, with a maximum of
about 1.8 MBit/s at normal CPU clock frequency or 2.5 MHz if CPU clock set to fast.


Build variables
---------------

.. envvar:: SPISOFT_DELAY_VARIABLE

   default: 0 (disabled)

   This setting must be enabled in order to use :cpp:func:`SPISoft::setDelay`.
   The base clock speed (i.e. delay=0) is reduced to about 1.4 MBit/s (2.1 MBit/s for fast CPU).

   The appropriate delay factor can be provided in the :cpp:class:`SPISoft` constructor,
   or by calling :cpp:func:`SPISoft::setDelay`.

   With the ESP8266, then the appropriate delay factor is calculated automatically from
   the speed passed in :cpp:class:`SPISettings`.
   This will override any previously set delay factor.
   Use a speed of 0 to use the manually configured delay value.


.. envvar:: SPISOFT_DELAY_FIXED

   default: 0 (disabled)
   maximum: 10

   Adds the requested number of 'NOP' CPU instructions to every clock transition.

   Has less impact than enabling variable delays.

   Use variable delays if 10 is insufficient.

   Will be ignored if variable delays are enabled.


Performance
-----------

The following information has been obtained by measurement.
The test application was built using:

.. code-block:: bash

   make SPISOFT_CALIBRATE=1 SPISOFT_DELAY_VARIABLE=1 CPU_FAST=0

then flashed to an ESP-12F. An oscilliscope was hooked up to the SCK output
and the maximum frequency at each delay setting noted.
(Not too awkward, just note down the frequency each time the figure changes.)

Entering these into the `spisoft.ods` spreadsheet allows the values to be charted and
co-efficients calculated.

Curiously values from 8 upward form a straight line so we can calculate those.
Smaller values are non-linear so a small lookup table is used.

Repeat for `CPU_FAST=1`.

Note that these figures are concerned with *maximum* (i.e. burst) frequencies
at each delay setting, since that is what devices are sensitive to.
