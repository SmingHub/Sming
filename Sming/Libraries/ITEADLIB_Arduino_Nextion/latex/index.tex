\section*{Nextion}





\section*{Introduction}

Nextion Arduino library provides an easy-\/to-\/use way to manipulate Nextion serial displays. Users can use the libarry freely, either in commerical projects or open-\/source prjects, without any additional condiitons.

For more information about the Nextion display project, please visit \href{http://wiki.iteadstudio.com/Nextion_HMI_Solution}{\tt the wikiã€‚} The wiki provdies all the necessary technical documnets, quick start guide, tutorials, demos, as well as some useful resources.

To get your Nextion display, please visit \href{http://imall.itead.cc/display/nextion.html}{\tt i\+Mall.}

\section*{Download Source Code}

Latest version is unstable and a mass of change may be applied in a short time without any notification for users. Commonly, it is for developers of this library.

{\bfseries Release version is recommanded for you, unless you are one of developers of this library.}

{\bfseries Release notes} is at \href{https://github.com/itead/ITEADLIB_Arduino_Nextion/blob/master/release_notes.md}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/itead/\+I\+T\+E\+A\+D\+L\+I\+B\+\_\+\+Arduino\+\_\+\+Nextion/blob/master/release\+\_\+notes.\+md}.

\section*{Documentation}

\href{http://docs.iteadstudio.com/ITEADLIB_Arduino_Nextion/index.html}{\tt Latest Online Documentation} contains Configuration, Get Started, Reference of A\+P\+I and Examples, etc.

Offline Documentation's entry {\ttfamily doc/\+Documentation/index.\+html} shiped with source code can be open in your browser such as Chrome, Firefox or any one you like.

\section*{Suppported Mainboards}

{\bfseries All boards, which has one or more hardware serial, can be supported.}

For example\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Iteaduino M\+E\+G\+A2560
\item Iteaduino U\+N\+O
\item Arduino M\+E\+G\+A2560
\item Arduino U\+N\+O
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{Configuration}

In configuration file \hyperlink{_nex_config_8h}{Nex\+Config.\+h}, you can find two macros below\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item db\+Serial\+: Debug Serial (baudrate\+:9600), needed by beginners for debug your nextion applications or sketches. If your complete your work, it will be a wise choice to disable Debug Serial.
\item nex\+Serial\+: Nextion Serial, the bridge of Nextion and your mainboard.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries Note\+:} the default configuration is for M\+E\+G\+A2560.

\subsection*{Redirect db\+Serial and nex\+Serial}

If you want to change the default serial to debug or communicate with Nextion , you need to modify the line in configuration file\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}#define dbSerial Serial    ---> #define dbSerial Serialxxx
#define nexSerial Serial2  ---> #define nexSeria Serialxxx
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsection*{Disable Debug Serial}

If you want to disable the debug information,you need to modify the line in configuration file\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}#define DEBUG_SERIAL_ENABLE ---> //#define DEBUG_SERIAL_ENABLE
\end{DoxyVerb}


\section*{U\+N\+O-\/like Mainboards}

If your board has only one hardware serial, such as U\+N\+O, you should disable db\+Serial and redirect nex\+Serial to Serial(Refer to section\+:{\ttfamily Serial configuration}).
