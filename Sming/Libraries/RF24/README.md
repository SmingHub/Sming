# Arduino driver for nRF24L01 2.4GHz Wireless Transceiver

Design Goals: This library is designed to be...

* Maximally compliant with the intended operation of the chip
* Easy for beginners to use
* Consumed with a public interface that's similiar to other Arduino standard libraries
* Built against the standard SPI library.

* [Chip Datasheet](http://www.nordicsemi.com/files/Product/data_sheet/nRF24L01_Product_Specification_v2_0.pdf)

This chip uses the SPI bus, plus two chip control pins.  Remember that pin 10 must still remain an output, or
the SPI hardware will go into 'slave' mode.
