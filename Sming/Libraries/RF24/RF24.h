 * NOW COMPATIBLE WITH ARDUINO 1.0 - The 'master' branch and all examples work with both Arduino 1.0 and earlier versions.  
 * Please <a href="https://github.com/maniacbug/RF24/issues/new">open an issue</a> if you find any problems using it with any version of Arduino.
 *
 * NOW COMPATIBLE WITH MAPLE - RF24 has been tested with the 
 * <a href="http://leaflabs.com/store/#Maple-Native">Maple Native</a>, 
 * and should work with any Maple board.  See the pingpair_maple example.
 * Note that only the pingpair_maple example has been tested on Maple, although
 * the others can certainly be adapted.
