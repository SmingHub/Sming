 * @section starting Where do I start?
 *
 * See my blog post: 
 * <a href="http://maniacbug.wordpress.com/2011/11/02/getting-started-rf24/">Getting Started with nRF24L01+ on Arduino</a>
 *
 * @section hardware Where can I buy some hardware?
 *
 * @li iTeadStudio sells the basic <a href="http://iteadstudio.com/store/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=7&products_id=53">2.4G Wireless nRF24L01+ Module</a> for $4.  Such a deal!
 * @li MDfly.com sells the same unit, <a href="http://www.mdfly.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=8_52&products_id=81">2.4Ghz Wireless nRF24L01+ Transceiver Module</a> for $6.95, but it ships from the US so it gets there a lot faster.  Great place to get a few units and get started quickly.
 * @li MDfly.com also has the <a href="http://www.mdfly.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=8_52&products_id=433">nRF24L01 2.4GHz Transceiver Module w/ Power Amplifier</a> for $13.95, which increases range dramatically and uses a chip antenna
 * @li MDfly.com also has the <a href="http://www.mdfly.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=8_52&products_id=583">2.4GHz Transceiver Module w/ Power Amplifier</a> with an external antenna for $19.95
 *
 * @section range What is the range of these units?
 *
 * Here are some results from measurements I have taken, using the basic $4 iTeadStudio units.  
 * I recommend that everyone take their own measurements in their particular circumstances.
 *
 * @li non-plus unit, 2MBps (worst case), 41+ ft line of sight indoors, immediate dropoff with any deviation from LOS.  (41 ft is as far as I can go in my house without turning a corner)
 * @li Plus unit, 250kbps (best case), 46 ft around two corners indoors, 49 ft around one corner.  More importantly, at 250k, packet loss is almost negligible through almost all of that range.
 * @li Both units at 1MBps, plus unit gets about 10% range improvement over non-plus in almost all situations.
 * 
 * @section issues What should I do if I find a problem?
 *
 * Please <a href="https://github.com/maniacbug/RF24/issues/new">open an issue</a> on github if you find any problems using it with any version of Arduino or Maple.
 *
 * @section ram What is the RAM footprint of this library?
 *
 * 16 bytes.  A single radio object consumes 16 bytes of RAM, and the library 
 * does not use any other RAM statically.
 * 
 * @section tests Why are the examples in the 'tests' directory failing?
 *
 * The sketches in the 'tests' directory are not for general use.
 * Please use the examples in the 'examples' directory instead.  
 *
 * The 'tests' directory is only for people making changes to the library
 * to ensure that their changes do not break anything.
