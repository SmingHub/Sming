Sming build system
==================

Introduction
------------

This guide is provided to assist with understanding, developing and
modifying the build system.

A Sming project is built from a set of static libraries (object
archives). Typically the application code is one library, built from the
user’s source code, whilst the other libraries are common to all
projects and stored in a separate, shared location.

Until recently Sming itself has always been built as one large library,
but this is now broken into a number of discrete Component libraries.
The concept is borrowed from Espressif’s ESP-IDF build system and whilst
it there are similarities the two systems are completely independent.

Building applications
---------------------

Setup
~~~~~

These are the main variables you need to be aware of:

``SMING_HOME`` must be set to the full path of the ``Sming`` directory.

``SMING_ARCH`` Defines the target architecture:

-  **Esp8266** The default if not specified. ``ESP_HOME`` must also be
   provided to locate SDK & tools.

-  **Esp32** {todo}

-  **Host** builds a version of the library for native host debugging on
   Linux or Windows

These variables are available for application use:

``PROJECT_DIR`` Path to the project’s root source directory, without
trailing path separator. This variable is available within makefiles,
but is also provided as a #defined C string to allow references to
source files within application code, such as with the ``IMPORT_FSTR``
macro.

``COMPONENT_PATH`` As for PROJECT_DIR, but provides the path to the
current component's root source directory.

Converting existing projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instead of ``Makefile-user.mk`` a project should provide a
``component.mk``. To convert to the new style:

1. Copy ``Makefile`` and ``component.mk`` from the ``Basic_Blink``
   sample project
2. Copy any customisations from ``Makefile-user.mk`` into
   ``component.mk`` file. (Or, rename ``Makefile-user.mk`` to
   ``component.mk`` then edit it.)
3. Delete ``Makefile-user.mk``
4. If the project uses any Arduino libraries, set the
   ``ARDUINO_LIBRARIES`` variable

**Targets** You can add your own targets to component.mk as usual. It’s
a good idea to add a comment for the target, like this:

::

   ##@Building

   .PHONY: mytarget
   mytarget: ##This is my target

When you type ``make help`` it will appear in the list.

If you need a target to be added as a dependency to the main application
build, add it to ``CUSTOM_TARGETS`` - the ``Basic_Serial`` sample
contains a simple example of this.

**Arduino Libraries** If your project uses any Arduino libraries, you
must set ``ARDUINO_LIBRARIES`` appropriately.

**Source files** Use ``COMPONENT_SRCDIRS`` instead of ``MODULES``. Use
``COMPONENT_SRCFILES`` to add individual files.

**Include paths** Use ``COMPONENT_INCDIRS`` instead of ``EXTRA_INCDIR``.

See `component.mk <#component-configuration>`__ for a full list of
variables.

Building
~~~~~~~~

You should normally work from the project directory. Examples:

-  Type ``make`` to build the project and any required Components. To
   speed things up, use parallel building, e.g. \ ``make -j5`` will
   build using a maximum of 5 concurrent jobs. The optimum value for
   this is usually (CPU CORES + 1). Using ``make -j`` will use unlimited
   jobs, but can cause problems in virtual environments.

-  Type ``make help`` from the project directory to get a list of
   available build targets.

To switch to a different build architecture, for example:

-  Type ``make SMING_ARCH=Host`` to build the project for the host
   emulator
-  Type ``make flash`` to copy any SPIFFS image (if enabled) to the
   virtual flash, and run the application. (Note that you don’t need to
   set SMING_ARCH again, the value is cached.)

To inspect the current build configuration, type ``make list-config``.

Configuration variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configuration variables should be set in the project’s component.mk
file. If appropriate, they can also be set as environment variables.

During development, the easiest way to change variables is on the
``make`` command line. These are cached so persist between make
sessions, and will override any values set in your project’s
``component.mk`` file. For example:

-  Type ``make SPIFF_BIN=test-rom`` to build the project and (if
   enabled) create a SPIFFS image file called ``test-rom.bin``
-  Type ``make flash COM_PORT=COM4 SPI_MODE=dio SPI_SIZE=4M`` to flash
   the project and ``test-rom`` SPIFFS image using the provided flash
   memory settings
-  Next time you type ``make flash``, the same settings will be used, no
   need to type them again

A separate cache is maintained for each build type (arch +
release/debug). For example:

-  Type ``make SMING_RELASE=1 list-config`` to switch to release build
   and display the active configuration

Type ``make config-clean`` to clear all caches and revert to defaults.

For reference, a copy of all build variables are stored in a file with
each firmware image created in the ‘firmware’ directory.

Component repositories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Placing Components in a common location allows them to be used by
multiple projects. To set up your own Component repository, create a
directory in a suitable location which will contain your Components and
set ``COMPONENT_SEARCH_DIRS`` to the full path of that directory. For
example:

.. code-block:: text

   |_ opt/
      |_ shared/
         |_ Components/             The repository
            |_ MyComponent/
            |_ AnotherComponent/
            |_ spiffs/              Will be used instead of Sming version
   
User repositories are searched first, which allows replacement of any
Component for a project. In this example, our ``spiffs`` component will
be selected instead of the one provided with Sming.

Directory layout
----------------

The main Sming repo. is laid out like this:

Components
----------

The purpose of a Component is to encapsulate related elements for
selective inclusion in a project, for easy sharing and re-use:

-  **Shared Library** with associated header files
-  **App Code** Source files to be compiled directly into the user’s
   project
-  **Header files** without any associated source or library
-  **Build targets** to perform specific actions, such as flashing
   binary data to hardware

By default, a Component is built into a shared library using any source
files found in the base or ``src`` directories. All Arduino Libraries
are built as Components. Note that the application is also built as a
Component library, but the source directory defaults to ``app`` instead
of ``src``.

Components are referred to simply by name, defined by the directory in
which it is stored. The Component itself is located by looking in all
the directories listed by ``COMPONENT_SEARCH_DIRS``, which contains a
list of repositories. (Every sub-directory of a repository is considered
to be a Component.) If there are Components with the same name in
different search directories, the first one found will be used.

Components are customised by providing an optional ``component.mk``
file.

You can see details of all Components used in a project using
``make list-components``. Add ``V=1`` to get more details.

Note that the application itself is also built as a Component, and may
be configured in a similar way to any other Component.

Library variants
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Libraries can often be built using different option settings, so a
mechanism is required to ensure that libraries (including the
application) are rebuilt if those settings change. This is handled using
*variants*, which modifies the library name using a hash of the settings
values. Each variant gets its own build sub-directory so incremental
building works as usual.

There are several types of config variable:

+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| Variable    | Cached?     | Rebuild     | Rebuild     | Relink      |
| type        |             | Component?  | application | application |
|             |             |             | ?           |             |
+=============+=============+=============+=============+=============+
| COMPONENT   | Y           | Y           | Y           | Y           |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| CONFIG      | Y           | N           | Y           | Y           |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| RELINK      | Y           | N           | N           | Y           |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| CACHE       | Y           | N           | N           | N           |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| DEBUG       | N           | N           | N           | N           |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+

Variables are usually defined in the context of a Component, in the
component.mk file. All Components see the full configuration during
building, not just their own variables.

The type of a configuration variable is defined by adding its *name* to
one of the following lists:

``CONFIG_VARS`` The Application library derives its variant from these
variables. Use this type if the Component doesn’t require a rebuild, but
the application does.

``COMPONENT_VARS`` A Component library derives its variant from these
variables. Any variable which requires a rebuild of the Component
library itself must be listed. For example, the ``esp-open-lwip``
Component defines this as ``ENABLE_LWIPDEBUG ENABLE_ESPCONN``. The
default values for these produces
``ENABLE_LWIPDEBUG=0 ENABLE_ESPCONN=0``, which is hashed (using MD5) to
produce ``a46d8c208ee44b1ee06f8e69cfa06773``, which is appended to the
library name.

``RELINK_VARS`` Code isn’t re-compiled, but libraries are re-linked and
firmware images re-generated if any of these variables are changed. For
example, ``make RBOOT_ROM_0=new-rom-file`` rewrites the firmware image
using the given filename. (Also, as the value is cached, if you then do
``make flashapp`` that same iamge gets flashed.)

``CACHE_VARS`` These variables have no effect on building, but are
cached. Variables such as ``COM_SPEED_ESPTOOL`` fall into this category.

``DEBUG_VARS`` are generally for information only, and are not cached
(except for :envvar:`SMING_ARCH` and :envvar:`SMING_RELEASE`).

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

``COMPONENT_DEPENDS`` identifies a list of Components upon which this
one depends. These are established as pre-requisites so will trigger a
rebuild. In addition, all dependent ``COMPONENT_VARS`` are (recursively)
used in creation of the library hash.

For example, the ``axtls-8266`` Component declares ``SSL_DEBUG`` as a
``COMPONENT_VAR``. Because ``Sming`` depends on ``sming-arch``, which in
turn depends on ``axtls-8266``, all of these Components get rebuilt as
different variants when ``SSL_DEBUG`` changes values. The project code
(``App`` Component) also gets rebuilt as it implicitly depends on
``Sming``.

GIT Submodules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sming uses source code from other repositories. Instead of including
local copies, these are handled using GIT submodules. Where changes are
required, patches may be provided as a diff .patch file and/or set of
files to be added/replaced. Only those submodules necessary for a build
are pulled in, as follows:

-  The submodule is fetched from its remote repository
-  If a .patch file exists, it is applied
-  Any additional files are copied into the submodule directory
-  An empty ``.submodule`` file is created to tells the build system
   that the submodule is present and correct.

The patch file must have the same name as the submodule, with a .patch
extension. It can be located in the submodule’s parent directory:

::

   |_ Components/
      |_ custom_heap/
         |_ .component.mk             Component definition
         |_ umm_malloc.patch          Diff patch file
         |_ umm_malloc/               Submodule directory
            |_ .submodule             Created after successful patching
         ...

However, if the Component is itself a submodule, then patch files must
be placed in a ``../.patches`` directory:

::

   |_ Libraries/
      |_ .patches/
      |  |_ Adafruit_SSD1306.patch    Diff patch file
      |  |_ Adafruit_SSD1306/
      |     |_ component.mk           This file is added to submodule
      |_ Adafruit_SSD1306/            The submodule directory
         |_ .submodule                Created after successful patching
         ...

This example includes additional files for the submodule. There are some
advantages to this approach:

1. Don’t need to modify or create .patch
2. Changes to the file are easier to follow than in a .patch
3. **IMPORTANT** Adding a component.mk file in this manner allows the
   build system to resolve dependencies before any submodules are
   fetched.

In the above example, the ``component.mk`` file defines a dependency on
the ``Adafruit_GFX`` library, so that will automatically get pulled in
as well.

Component configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``component.mk`` is parsed twice, first from the top-level makefile
and the second time from the sub-make which does the actual building. A
number of variables are used to define behaviour.

These values are for reference only and should not be modified.

``COMPONENT_NAME`` Name of the Component ``COMPONENT_PATH`` Base
directory path for Component, no trailing path separator
``COMPONENT_BUILD_DIR`` The current directory. This should be used if
the Component provides any application code or targets to ensure it is
built in the correct directory (but not by this makefile).
``COMPONENT_LIBDIR`` Location to store created Component (shared)
libraries ``COMPONENT_VARIANT`` Name of the library to build
``COMPONENT_LIBPATH`` Full path to the library to be built

These values may be used to customise Component behaviour and may be
changed as required.

``COMPONENT_LIBNAME`` By default, the library has the same name as the
Component but can be changed if required. Note that this will be used as
the stem for any variants. Set ``COMPONENT_LIBNAME :=`` if the Component
doesn’t create a library. If you don’t do this, a default library will
be built but will be empty if no source files are found.

``COMPONENT_TARGETS`` Set this to any additional targets to be built as
part of the Component, prefixed with ``$(COMPONENT_RULE)``. If targets
should be built for each application, use ``CUSTOM_TARGETS`` instead.
See ``spiffs`` for an example.

``COMPONENT_RULE`` This is a special value used to prefix any custom
targets which are to be built as part of the Component. The target must
be prefixed by ``$(COMPONENT_RULE)`` without any space between it and
the target. This ensures the rule only gets invoked during a component
build, and is ignored by the top-level make.

``COMPONENT_SUBMODULES`` Relative paths to dependent submodule
directories for this Component. These will be fetched/patched
automatically before building.

``COMPONENT_SRCDIRS`` Locations for source code relative to
COMPONENT_PATH (defaults to “. src”)

``COMPONENT_INCDIRS`` Include directories available when building ALL
Components (not just this one). Paths may be relative or absolute.
Defaults to “include”.

``INCDIR`` The resultant set of include directories used to build this
Component. Will contain include directories specified by all other
Components in the build. May be overridden if required.

``COMPONENT_APPCODE`` List of directories containing source code to be
compiled directly with the application. (Ignore in the project.mk file -
use ``COMPONENT_SRCDIRS`` instead).

``CUSTOM_BUILD`` Set to 1 if providing an alternative build method. See
`Custom building <#custom-building>`__ section.

``EXTRA_OBJ`` Absolute paths to any additional binary object files to be
added to the Component archive library.

``COMPONENT_DEPENDS`` Set to the name(s) of any dependent Components.

``EXTRA_LIBS`` Set to names of any additional libraries to be linked.

``EXTRA_LDFLAGS`` Set to any additional flags to be used when linking.

These values are global so must only be appended to (with ``+=``) ,
never overwritten.

``CUSTOM_TARGETS`` Identifies targets to be built along with the
application. These will be invoked directly by the top-level make.

``GLOBAL_CFLAGS`` Use only if you need to provide additional compiler
flags to be included when building all Components (including
Application) and custom targets.

``APP_CFLAGS`` Used when building application and custom targets.

``COMPONENT_CFLAGS`` Will be visible **ONLY** to C code within the component.

``COMPONENT_CXXFLAGS`` Will be visible **ONLY** to C++ code within the component.


**IMPORTANT NOTE**

During initial parsing, many of these variables (specifically, the
``COMPONENT_xxx`` ones) *do not* keep their values. For this reason it
is usually best to use simple variable assignment using ``:=``.

For example, in ``Esp8266/Components/gdbstub`` we define
``GDB_CMDLINE``. It may be tempting to do this::

   GDB_CMDLINE = trap '' INT; $(GDB) -x $(COMPONENT_PATH)/gdbcmds -b $(COM_SPEED_GDB) -ex "target remote $(COM_PORT_GDB)"

That won’t work! By the time ``GDB_CMDLINE`` gets expanded,
``COMPONENT_PATH`` could contain anything. We need ``GDB_CMDLINE`` to be
expanded only when used, so the solution is to take a simple copy of
``COMPONENT_PATH`` and use it instead, like this::

   GDBSTUB_DIR := $(COMPONENT_PATH)
   GDB_CMDLINE = trap '' INT; $(GDB) -x $(GDBSTUB_DIR)/gdbcmds -b $(COM_SPEED_GDB) -ex "target remote $(COM_PORT_GDB)"

Building
~~~~~~~~

For faster builds use make with the ``-j`` (jobs) feature of make. It is
usually necessary to specify a limit for the number of jobs, especially
on virtual machines. There is usually no point in using a figure greater
than (CPU cores + 1). The CI builds use ``-j3``.

Note that ``Makefile-app.mk`` enforces sequential building to ensure
submodules are fetched and patched correctly. This also ensures that
only one Component is built at a time which keeps the build logs quite
clean and easy to follow.

Components can be rebuilt and cleaned individually. For example:

-  ``make spiffs-build`` runs the Component ‘make’ for spiffs, which
   contains the spiffs library and spiffy tool.
-  ``make spiffs-clean`` removes all intermediate build files for the
   Component
-  ``make spiffs-rebuild`` cleans and then re-builds the Component

By default, a regular ``make`` performs an incremental build on the
application, which invokes a separate (recursive) make for the ``App``
Component. All other Components only get built if any of their targets
don’t exist (e.g. variant library not yet built). This makes application
building faster and less ‘busy’, which is generally preferable for
regular application development. For Component development this
behaviour can be changed using the ``FULL_COMPONENT_BUILD`` variable
(which is cached). Examples:

-  ``make FULL_COMPONENT_BUILD=lwip`` will perform an incremental build
   on the ``lwip`` Component
-  ``make FULL_COMPONENT_BUILD=1`` will incrementally build all
   Components

Custom Building
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use an external makefile or other build system (such as CMake) to
create the Component library, or to add additional shared libraries or
other targets, customise the ``component.mk`` file as follows:

1. Set ``CUSTOM_BUILD=1``
2. Define the custom rule, prefixed with ``$(COMPONENT_RULE)``. Note
   that Components are built using a separate make instance with the
   current directory set to the build output directory, not the source
   directory.

It is important that the rule uses the provided values for
``COMPONENT_LIBNAME``, ``COMPONENT_LIBPATH`` and ``COMPONENT_LIBDIR`` so
that variant building, cleaning, etc. work correctly. See below under
‘Building’, and the Host ``lwip`` Component for an example.

Components are built using a make instance with the current directory
set to the build output directory, not the source directory. If any
custom building is done then these variables must be obeyed to ensure
variants, etc. work as expected:

``COMPONENT_LIBNAME`` as provided by component.mk, defaults to component
name, e.g. \ ``Sming`` ``COMPONENT_LIBHASH`` hash of the component
variables used to create unique library names,
e.g. \ ``13cd2ddef79fda79dae1644a33bf48bb`` ``COMPONENT_VARIANT`` name
of the library to be built, including hash.
e.g. \ ``Sming-13cd2ddef79fda79dae1644a33bf48bb`` ``COMPONENT_LIBDIR``
directory where any generated libraries must be output,
e.g. \ ``/home/user/sming/Sming/out/Esp8266/debug/lib/``
``COMPONENT_LIBPATH`` full path to the library to be created,
e.g. \ ``/home/user/sming/Sming/out/Esp8266/debug/lib/clib-Sming-13cd2ddef79fda79dae1644a33bf48bb.a``
``COMPONENT_BUILDDIR`` where to write intermediate object files,
e.g. \ ``/home/user/sming/Sming/out/Esp8266/debug/build/Sming/Sming-13cd2ddef79fda79dae1644a33bf48bb``

Known Issues
------------

**Cleaning** Components are not cleaned unless defined.
e.g. \ ``make axtls-8266-clean`` will fail unless you also specify
``ENABLE_SSL=1``.

**Empty libraries** Components without any source code produce an empty
library. This is because, for simplicity, we don’t want to add a
component.mk to every Arduino library.

**Empty Component directories** Every sub-directory in the
``COMPONENT_SEARCH_DIRS`` is interpreted as a Component. For example,
``spiffs`` was moved out of Arch/Esp8266/Components but if an empty
directory called ‘spiffs’ still remains then it will be picked up
instead of the main one. These sorts of issues can be checked using
``make list-components`` to ensure the correct Component path has been
selected.
