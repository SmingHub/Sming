Debugging
---------

Sming applications can be debugged using an interactive debugger.

.. note::

    Many issues can be more easily resolved in the :doc:`Host Emulator <host>` than attempting to debug on the target device.

    In addition, static analysis tools can identify many actual or potential issues in code without actually running it. See :envvar:`ENABLE_SANITIZERS`.

Further details on debugging can be found in these pages.
