Host Emulator
=============

.. highlight:: bash

Sming allows most libraries and sample applications to be compiled on a Linux/MacOs/Windows
development system and be tested before uploading them to the microcontroller.

If you want to try it we have an
`interactive tutorial <https://killercoda.com/slaff/scenario/sming-host-emulator>`__
that can be run directly from your browser.

For installation details see :doc:`/getting-started/index`.

For full details see :doc:`/_inc/Sming/Arch/Host/README`.
