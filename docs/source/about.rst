Sming
-----

Sming is an asynchronous C/C++ framework with superb performance and multiple network features.
Sming is open source and is tailored towards embedded devices. It supports multiple architectures.

The project was started in 2015 and is actively developed.

Arduino
-------
Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software.
Sming is compatible with (most) standard `Arduino libraries <https://sming.readthedocs.io/en/latest/libraries.html>`_,
which means that you can use any popular hardware in few lines of code.


ESP8266
-------

`ESP8266 <https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp8266ex/overview>`__ is a microcontroller with Wi-Fi,
manufactured by `Espressif <https://espressif.com>`__ Systems.
It is the first microcontroller that was supported from Sming.
Sming provides access to all ESP8266 functions such as GPIO, timers, WiFi configuration, etc.


ESP32
-----

`ESP32 <https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32>`__ is the second microcontroller by `Espressif <https://espressif.com>`__ Systems.
There are also a number of more recent variants such as the esp32-s2 and esp32-c3.

Sming currently provides support for these devices but is more limited and should be considered 'experimental'.
