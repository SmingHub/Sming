Install docker :
================

Visit the official `Docker Installation
Page <https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/>`__ and follow the
instructions tailored for your operating system.

Install docker-compose
======================

Docker Compose makes dealing with the orchestration processes of Docker
containers (such as starting up, shutting down, and setting up
intra-container linking and volumes) really easy.

With docker compose we can define the entire multi-container application
in single file and then the application can be spinned up using one
command.

Visit the official `Docker Compose Installation
Page <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>`__ and follow the
instructions tailored for your operating system.
