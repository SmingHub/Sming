Financial contributions
-----------------------

We welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our `open
collective <https://opencollective.com/Sming>`__ page. They help us
improve the project and the community around it. If you would like to
support us you can `become a
backer <https://opencollective.com/Sming#backer>`__ or `a
sponsor <https://opencollective.com/Sming#sponsor>`__.

In addition to that anyone who is helping this project can file an
expense. If the expense makes sense for the development of the
community, it will be “merged” in the ledger of our open collective by
the core contributors and the person who filed the expense will be
reimbursed.
