Summary
=======


Stream methods
--------------

The :c:func:`Stream::readBytes` has been virtualised and overriden for :cpp:class:`IDataSourceStream`
descendents for more efficient operation, especially with ArduinoJson.
For normal read operations where the stream position is to be updated, applications should use
this method in preference to :c:func:`IDataSourceStream::readMemoryBlock`.

An addition method :cpp:func:`IDataSourceStream::moveString` has been added to support extracting
the content of a memory-based stream into a String object without duplicating the data.
This is supported by :cpp:class:`LimitedMemoryStream` and :cpp:class:`MemoryDataStream`.


getBody methods
---------------

The :cpp:func:`HttpRequest::getBody` and :cpp:func:`HttpResponse::getBody` methods have been revised to use
move semantics. Previously, the data was copied into a new String which effectively doubled memory usage.

If you have set a non-memory stream type (e.g. :cpp:class:`FileStream`) which does not implement `:cpp:func:`IDataSourceStream::moveString()`
then an invalid String will be returned. In this situation you should use :cpp:func:`HttpResponse::getBodyStream` instead.
