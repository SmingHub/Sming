Summary
=======


Stream methods
--------------

The :c:func:`Stream::readBytes` has been virtualised and overriden for :cpp:class:`IDataSourceStream`
descendents for more efficient operation, especially with ArduinoJson.
For normal read operations where the stream position is to be updated, applications should use
this method in preference to :c:func:`IDataSourceStream::readMemoryBlock`.

An addition method :cpp:func:`IDataSourceStream::moveString` has been added to support extracting
the content of a memory-based stream into a String object without duplicating the data.
This is supported by :cpp:class:`LimitedMemoryStream` and :cpp:class:`MemoryDataStream`.


getBody methods
---------------

A ``size_t`` parameter has been added to :cpp:func:`HttpRequest::getBody` and :cpp:func:`HttpResponse::getBody`.
This is to restrict the amount of memory which might be allocated to the returned :cpp:class:`String` object.

This can be used to help mitigate memory-overflow attacks.
You should generally choose a value no greater than absolutely necessary for the expected body size.

For larger amounts of data use :cpp:func:`HttpResponse::getBodyStream` instead.
