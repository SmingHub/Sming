SPI Byte/Bit ordering
---------------------

The :cpp:class:`SPISettings` class has been revised to be consistent with Arduino ESP8266, ESP32, RP2040, etc.
which provide a **bitOrder** setting but not ``byteOrder``.

Bytes are now always sent LSB first, which corresponds with the system endianness.
Bit order simply indicates how the bits within each byte are sent on the wire.
This is predominantly MSB first, the default.

The :cpp:class:`SPISoft` class has been upgraded to support bit ordering, transactions
and includes automatic delay calculation for the ESP8266.

See :issue:`1428`.
