Network support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If WiFi is not required then the :envvar:`DISABLE_WIFI` setting can be used to reduce code size.
This has a more pronounced effect for the ESP8266 which uses an experimental library.

The core network code has been moved out of ``Sming/Core/Network`` and into a separate component at ``Components/Network``.
Some support code has been moved into ``Core/Data/WebHelpers``: applications should still build OK but you will get
a compiler warning advising of the changes.

Note that ``Network/WebHelpers/aw-sha1.h`` has been removed in favour of the :component:`crypto` library.

Ethernet support has been added, currently only for the ESP32 embedded MAC.
If WiFi is not used then the :envvar:`DISABLE_WIFI` setting can be used to reduce code size.

The :envvar:`DISABLE_NETWORK` setting can be used to exclude all networking support for significant code size reduction.


ESP32
~~~~~

If you have made use of Sming's experimental ESP32 support then you will need to update the ESP IDF SDK and tools to version 4.3.
See :doc:`/_inc/Sming/Arch/Esp32/README`.
