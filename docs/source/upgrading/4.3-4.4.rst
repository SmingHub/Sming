Network support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The core network code has been moved out of ``Sming/Core/Network`` and into a separate component at ``Components/Network``.
This is to extend the use of the :envvar:`DISABLE_WIFI` setting to reduce the code required to be built for applications which
do not require networking.

Some support code has been moved into ``Core/Data/WebHelpers``: applications should still build OK but you will get
a compiler warning advising of the changes.

Note that ``Network/WebHelpers/aw-sha1.h`` has been removed in favour of the :component:`crypto` library.
