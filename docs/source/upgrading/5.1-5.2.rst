From v5.1 to v5.2

.. highlight:: c++

**Breaking change**

The :cpp:class:`Storage::PartitionStream` constructors with ``blockErase`` parameter have been deprecated.
The intended default behaviour is read-only, however previously this also allowed writing without block erase.
This can result in corrupted flash contents where the flash has not been explicitly erased beforehand.

The new constructors instead use a :cpp:enum:`Storage::Mode` so behaviour is more explicit.
The default is read-only and writes will now be failed.
