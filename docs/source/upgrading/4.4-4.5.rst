From v4.4 to v4.5
=================

.. highlight:: c++

Template Streams
----------------

The :cpp:class:`TemplateStream` class has been updated to improve tag recognition (:pull-request:`2400`).
This means regular ``{varname}`` tags are sufficient for most purposes, including JSON templates.

The :cpp:class:`IFS::JsonDirectoryTemplate` previously used double-brace tags such as ``{{varname}}``.
It now uses regular tags by default, so if you use this class either:

1. Add a call to :cpp:func:`TemplateStream::setDoubleBraces` in your code, or
2. Update your templates to use single braces


Eclipse Project Files
---------------------

Starting with version 4.5.x we don't provide Eclipse meta files in our samples. 
These can be generated using the ``ide-eclipse`` makefile target.
For more information read the updated :doc:`/tools/eclipse`.
