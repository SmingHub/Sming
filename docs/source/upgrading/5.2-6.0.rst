**Esp32 task scheduling**

Sming is a single-threaded framework, so does not impose any requirements on application code to be thread-safe.
However, code could be executed from one of several tasks (wifi, tcpip or Sming) which is a reliability concern.

With PR#2913 this has been fixed and all Sming code now runs in the same task context.
This has largely be achieved by using a separate callback queue for Sming rather than using the IDF mechanism.
