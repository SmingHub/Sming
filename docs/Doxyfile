# If the INLINE_INHERITED_MEMB tag is set to YES, doxygen will show all
# inherited members of a class in the documentation of that class as if those

# operators of the base classes will not be shown.
# The default value is: NO.

INLINE_INHERITED_MEMB  = YES

# If the FULL_PATH_NAMES tag is set to YES, doxygen will prepend the full path
# before files name in the file list and in the header files. If set to NO the
# shortest path that makes the file name unique will be used
# The default value is: YES.

FULL_PATH_NAMES        = NO

# The TAB_SIZE tag can be used to set the number of spaces in a tab. Doxygen
# uses this value to replace tabs by spaces in code fragments.

TAB_SIZE               = 4

# This tag can be used to specify a number of aliases that act as commands in
# the documentation. An alias has the form:
# name=value
# For example adding
# "sideeffect=@par Side Effects:\n"
# will allow you to put the command \sideeffect (or @sideeffect) in the
# documentation, which will result in a user-defined paragraph with heading
# "Side Effects:". You can put \n's in the value part of an alias to insert
# newlines.

# If the EXTRACT_STATIC tag is set to YES, all static members of a file will be

# Set the SHOW_USED_FILES tag to NO to disable the list of files generated at

# The default value is: YES.

SHOW_USED_FILES        = NO

# Set the SHOW_FILES tag to NO to disable the generation of the Files page. This

# The EXCLUDE tag can be used to specify files and/or directories that should be

#
# Note that relative paths are relative to the directory from which doxygen is

# Note that the wildcards are matched against the file with absolute path, so to
# exclude all test directories for example use the pattern */test/*

# The EXCLUDE_SYMBOLS tag can be used to specify one or more symbol names
# (namespaces, classes, functions, etc.) that should be excluded from the
# output. The symbol name can be a fully qualified name, a word, or if the
# wildcard * is used, a substring. Examples: ANamespace, AClass,

# Configuration options related to source browsing
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the SOURCE_BROWSER tag is set to YES then a list of source files will be
# generated. Documented entities will be cross-referenced with these sources.
#
# Note: To get rid of all source code in the generated output, make sure that
# also VERBATIM_HEADERS is set to NO.
# The default value is: NO.

SOURCE_BROWSER         = NO

# Setting the INLINE_SOURCES tag to YES will include the body of functions,
# classes and enums directly into the documentation.
# The default value is: NO.

INLINE_SOURCES         = NO

# Setting the STRIP_CODE_COMMENTS tag to YES will instruct doxygen to hide any
# special comment blocks from generated source code fragments. Normal C, C++ and
# Fortran comments will always remain visible.
# The default value is: YES.

STRIP_CODE_COMMENTS    = YES

# If the REFERENCED_BY_RELATION tag is set to YES then for each documented
# function all documented functions referencing it will be listed.
# The default value is: NO.

REFERENCED_BY_RELATION = NO

# If the REFERENCES_RELATION tag is set to YES then for each documented function
# all documented entities called/used by that function will be listed.
# The default value is: NO.

REFERENCES_RELATION    = NO

# If the REFERENCES_LINK_SOURCE tag is set to YES and SOURCE_BROWSER tag is set
# to YES then the hyperlinks from functions in REFERENCES_RELATION and
# REFERENCED_BY_RELATION lists will link to the source code. Otherwise they will
# link to the documentation.
# The default value is: YES.

REFERENCES_LINK_SOURCE = YES

# If SOURCE_TOOLTIPS is enabled (the default) then hovering a hyperlink in the
# source code will show a tooltip with additional information such as prototype,
# brief description and links to the definition and documentation. Since this
# will make the HTML file larger and loading of large files a bit slower, you
# can opt to disable this feature.
# The default value is: YES.
# This tag requires that the tag SOURCE_BROWSER is set to YES.

SOURCE_TOOLTIPS        = YES

# If the USE_HTAGS tag is set to YES then the references to source code will
# point to the HTML generated by the htags(1) tool instead of doxygen built-in
# source browser. The htags tool is part of GNU's global source tagging system
# (see http://www.gnu.org/software/global/global.html). You will need version
# 4.8.6 or higher.
#
# To use it do the following:
# - Install the latest version of global
# - Enable SOURCE_BROWSER and USE_HTAGS in the config file
# - Make sure the INPUT points to the root of the source tree
# - Run doxygen as normal
#
# Doxygen will invoke htags (and that will in turn invoke gtags), so these
# tools must be available from the command line (i.e. in the search path).
#
# The result: instead of the source browser generated by doxygen, the links to
# source code will now point to the output of htags.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag SOURCE_BROWSER is set to YES.

USE_HTAGS              = NO

# If the VERBATIM_HEADERS tag is set the YES then doxygen will generate a
# verbatim copy of the header file for each class for which an include is
# specified. Set to NO to disable this.
# See also: Section \class.
# The default value is: YES.

VERBATIM_HEADERS       = YES

# If the CLANG_ASSISTED_PARSING tag is set to YES then doxygen will use the
# clang parser (see: http://clang.llvm.org/) for more accurate parsing at the
# cost of reduced performance. This can be particularly helpful with template
# rich C++ code for which doxygen's built-in parser lacks the necessary type
# information.
# Note: The availability of this option depends on whether or not doxygen was
# compiled with the --with-libclang option.
# The default value is: NO.

CLANG_ASSISTED_PARSING = NO

# If clang assisted parsing is enabled you can provide the compiler with command
# line options that you would normally use when invoking the compiler. Note that
# the include paths will already be set by doxygen for the files and directories
# specified with INPUT and INCLUDE_PATH.
# This tag requires that the tag CLANG_ASSISTED_PARSING is set to YES.

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the alphabetical class index
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the ALPHABETICAL_INDEX tag is set to YES, an alphabetical index of all
# compounds will be generated. Enable this if the project contains a lot of
# classes, structs, unions or interfaces.
# The default value is: YES.

ALPHABETICAL_INDEX     = YES

# The COLS_IN_ALPHA_INDEX tag can be used to specify the number of columns in
# which the alphabetical index list will be split.
# Minimum value: 1, maximum value: 20, default value: 5.
# This tag requires that the tag ALPHABETICAL_INDEX is set to YES.

COLS_IN_ALPHA_INDEX    = 5

# In case all classes in a project start with a common prefix, all classes will
# be put under the same header in the alphabetical index. The IGNORE_PREFIX tag
# can be used to specify a prefix (or a list of prefixes) that should be ignored
# while generating the index headers.
# This tag requires that the tag ALPHABETICAL_INDEX is set to YES.

# listings (including syntax highlighting and cross-referencing information) to
# the XML output. Note that enabling this will significantly increase the size
# of the XML output.
# The default value is: YES.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_XML is set to YES.

XML_PROGRAMLISTING     = NO


#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the preprocessor
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The PREDEFINED tag can be used to specify one or more macro names that are
# defined before the preprocessor is started (similar to the -D option of e.g.
# gcc). The argument of the tag is a list of macros of the form: name or
# name=definition (no spaces). If the definition and the "=" are omitted, "=1"
# is assumed. To prevent a macro definition from being undefined via #undef or
# recursively expanded use the := operator instead of the = operator.
# This tag requires that the tag ENABLE_PREPROCESSING is set to YES.
