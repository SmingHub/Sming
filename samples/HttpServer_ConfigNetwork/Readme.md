# Introduction

The HTTP server coming with Sming is quite powerful but it is limited from the available resources of the underlining hardware (your favorite ESP8266 microcontroller). Serving multiple files at once can be problematic. It is not the size of the files that can cause problems, but the number of simultaneous files that need to be delivered. Therefore if you serve multiple CSS or JS files you can optimize your web application before uploading it into your ESP8266 using the advice below.

# Optimizing File Delivery

In this example you will see how to combine CSS and JS files, compress them and deliver the optimized content via the HTTP server.

## Installation

The file optimization uses `gulp`. To install it and the needed gulp packages you need to install first [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). 
Npm is the Node.JS package manager.  Once you are done with the installation you can run from the command line the following:

  npm install
  
 The command above will install gulp and its dependencies.
 
## Usage

During the development of your web application you should work only in the `web/dev/` folder. Once you are ready with the application you can `pack` the resources and `upload` them to your device. The commands are

  make web-pack
  make web-upload
  
That should be it.
