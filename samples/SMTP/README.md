# Purpose of this Sample Code
To show the basics of sending an email via SMTP

# SMTP

When an IOT device detects a malfunction, it is good to be able to notify the user. 
We can do that either by sending them an email or via a service like MQTT. 

This sample shows how to send an email via SMTP directly from the ESP8266.

smtp2go conveniently provides a free account.

It needs some configuration:
* the name of the SMTP server, eg "mail.smtp2go.com"
* a username and password
* the name and email of the person from whom the email will be sent
* the name and email of the person to send the email to

Edit the sample to replace these values and the SSID etc.
