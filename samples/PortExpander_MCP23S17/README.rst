MCP23S17 SPI Port Expander
==========================

You can easily add more GPIO connections for an ESP8266 using a port expander.
This example demonstrates how to do that with a common SPI port expander.

These devices are perhaps a little less common than their I2C equivalents,
see :sample:`PortExpander_MCP23017`.
