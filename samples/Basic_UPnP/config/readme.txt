Our Wemo device just returns XML service information using files in this directory.
With further development, this information will be generated dynamically as currently
happens with device information.

wemo-device.xml - For information only. This is generated dynamically for Wemo devices.
wemo-metadata.xml - Returned by the Wemo MetaInfo Service.
wemo-service.xml - Returned by the Wemo Basic Event Service.
