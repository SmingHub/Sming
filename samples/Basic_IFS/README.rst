Basic IFS
=========

.. highlight:: bash

Simple Webserver demonstration using IFS.

View the filesystem using a web browser.

To see directory content in a different format, append ``?format=XX``, one of:

- ``json``
- ``text``
- ``html``

Use the format ``archive`` to retrieve an archive/backup of the directory tree as an FWFS image.


Building
--------

By default, data is stored in a read-only FWFS (Firmware Filesystem) partition.

This sample also demonstrates how to store the data in a :cpp:class:`FlashString` object::

    make config-clean
    make ENABLE_FLASHSTRING_IMAGE=1

Because the data is linked into the program image this is only suitable for small filesystem images.
This could be used to store default recovery data, especially with OTA updates because each program
image is self-contained.
