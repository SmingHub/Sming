/** @brief Low-level interrupt handler

 *  Interrupt processing code should be as short as possible.
 *  You could perhaps set a flag, then check it in your main code (timers, etc) or read actual
 *  pin state and save it to a global variable.
 *  Avoid doing things like calling malloc(), new(), reading Flash memory.
 *  If your application is not timing-critical, then use an InterruptDelegate callback instead.

	/* OK, so you probably got a number which hit 255 pretty quickly! It stays there to indicate the task queue
	 * overflowed, which happens because we're getting way more interrupts than we can process in a timely manner, so
	 * lots of them get dropped.
	 *
	 * So what's happening?
	 *
	 * In our example, if you use a jumper wire to ground the input pin then it will bounce around as contact is made
	 * and then broken; this is known as 'contact bounce'. This means you'll get multiple outputs instead of a clean
	 * signal. If your circuit uses a push switch, reed switch, etc. then you'll need a 'debounce circuit'.
	 *
	 * If you want to try a very simple debounce circuit to see what happens, try this:
	 *
	 *                3v3
	 *                _|_
	 *                ___ 100nF
	 *                 |
	 *                 |
	 * INPUT   >--------------> GPIO PIN
	 *
	 * You'll need to hit the reset button to get the task counter back to 0. Now try toggling the input again...
	 * I'll leave it to you to work out why this helps. Hint: We've enabled pullups on the input pins, so there
	 * will be another resistor in the circuit.
	 *
	 * There is plenty of information available on this subject. Just search the internet for 'debounce circuit'.
