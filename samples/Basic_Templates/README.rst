Basic Templates
===============

Simple demonstration of how to use Template streams.

The program uses two sets of data:

- cars.csv from https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/cars/
- classics.csv from https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/classics/

Templates are used to display filtered data from these in text, JSON and XML formats.

Although the data is just printed to the serial terminal, it can just as easily be
sent over a network link as in the :sample:`Basic_IFS` sample.
