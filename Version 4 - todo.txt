Station.cpp

  Provide alternative method for enumerating BssInfo. It's inefficient and clunky.
  The list is a linked list so requires only a single object to wrap the data,
  with accessor methods to translate as required. Add a next() method to get the next
  entry, and a reset() method to start again.
  
  Consider whether we need to retain support for the existing mechanism.
  
  NB. There may be other instances where a Vector is just lazy programming. We've already
  deprecated one in FileSystem.cpp :-)

  
String

  add case-insensitive compare methods, or use a flag on existing methods
  

DateTime / Timezone / SolarCalculator

  Add format() method for dates and times.
  Provide built-in selection for default formats, e.g.
    AM/PM or 24-hour
    d/m/y or m/d/y
    etc.
  Optimise. parseHttpDate, for example.
  
    
IOControl model

  Consider how to integrate this. Would it be better to pass configuration using something
  other than JSON ? Callback, perhaps ?
  
EndlessMemoryStream

  Establish where this is used and document to tighten up specification. Suspect it's only
  used for chunked transfers. Could be useful for performing transfers from an
  IORequest callback.
  
Authentication

  FTPServer has it's own method for login/password storage. There is an implicit need for
  a general authentication module which deals with all this. It can maintain such information
  and perform authentication, returning UserRole values, etc. The class will be
  overridable to perform custom application stuff.
