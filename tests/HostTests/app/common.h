/*
 * Common test code
 *
 * - A test module contains all code for testing a specific aspect of the framework
 * - If a module contains more than one file then place all files in a sub-directory
 * - Each module must have a registration function
 * -	Use the REGISTER_TEST macro to name the function
 * -	Add an entry to the `modules.h` file
 * - Each module contains one or more test groups
 * - 	Each group is a class inheriting from TestGroup
 * -	Add a call to `registerGroup<>` to the registration function for each test class
 * - Keep each group brief. Use multiple, simpler groups if necessary.
 * - The group `execute()` method is called to run the tests. On return the group is considered to
 *   have been successfully completed and destroyed.
 * - Within a group, individual tests should be marked by calling `startTest()`
 * - Call `TEST_ASSERT()` at appropriate points; passing `false` will fail the test and abort the process,
 *   displaying the source location of the failure.
 * - If a test fails then additional details may be shown before calling `TEST_ASSERT(false)`.
 * - For asynchronous testing calling `pending()` before returning. When the tests have been completed
 * 	 call `complete()`. (See `test-timers` for an example.)
 *
 * What happens:
 *
 * - The `registerGroup<>` function creates a factory function which is added to the `groupFactories` list
 * - Each group is created, executed then destroyed in turn.
 *
 * Notes
 *
 * Tests are run with DEBUG_VERBOSE_LEVEL at WARNING level, so `debug_i` statements will not normally be shown.
 * Tests can use other `debug_X` functions as required, or `Serial` print methods.
 *
 * Tests should compile and run for all architectures.
 *
