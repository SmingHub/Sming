SmartConfig is a mechanism to configure a device as quickly as possible with the intermediate help of a smart phone
and with least interaction from a human as possible.

Basically your ESP device looks for Access Points (AP). When it finds an AP with special signature 
it tries to extract data like SSID and password from it. Meanwhile your smart phone tries to send that information. 

The example here shows how to use ESP_TOUCH method to do smart configuration on the device. It is a C++ conversion of the C
code that Espressif provides in the SDK examples. 

What you will need also is the code that has to be run on your smart phone.
Espressif already released some sample code and you can try:
